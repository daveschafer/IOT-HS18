# Arduino Uno Edge Device

The Arduino is needed to access the Grove Air Quality Sensor. The Raspberry Pi has no analog GPIOS, which is why you need the Arduino.  
You could also you a simple A2D Converter, which we had not at the time.

## HW Setup
Connect Raspberry Pi to Arduino by USB.

If you want to connect it by the GPIO Pins, you will need a Level Shifter like the Adafruit BSS138.
